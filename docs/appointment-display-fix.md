# Appointment Display Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The system was only showing appointments for tomorrow (August 11) and not showing appointments scheduled for today (August 10) at 11:59 PM.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to date/time comparison in both the backend and frontend:

1. In the backend (DashboardController.php), the query was filtering appointments using:
   ```php
   ->where('scheduled_for', '>=', Carbon::today()->startOfDay())
   ```
   This excluded appointments from yesterday (like those at 11:59 PM on August 10) because the server time had already passed midnight.

2. In the frontend (dashboard.tsx), the "isToday" logic was using:
   ```typescript
   const isToday = appointmentDate.toDateString() === today.toDateString();
   ```
   This would only highlight appointments from the current calendar day, not considering late night appointments from the previous day.

## Solution

### Backend Changes
We modified the DashboardController.php to include appointments from the previous day after 6 PM (18:00):

```php
->where(function($query) {
    // Include appointments from today onwards OR from yesterday after 18:00
    $query->where('scheduled_for', '>=', Carbon::today()->startOfDay())
          ->orWhere(function($subQuery) {
              $subQuery->whereDate('scheduled_for', Carbon::yesterday())
                      ->where('scheduled_for', '>=', Carbon::yesterday()->setHour(18)->setMinute(0)->setSecond(0));
          });
})
```

This change was applied to all user roles (technical, member, owner/doorman, admin) in the DashboardController.

### Frontend Changes
We enhanced the frontend to identify and highlight late night appointments from yesterday:

1. Added logic to detect yesterday's late appointments:
   ```typescript
   const isYesterdayLate = (() => {
       const yesterday = new Date();
       yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
       return appointmentDate.toDateString() === yesterday.toDateString() && 
              appointmentDate.getHours() >= 18;
   })();
   
   // Treat late night appointments from yesterday as "today"
   const showAsTodayAppointment = isToday || isYesterdayLate;
   ```

2. Updated all styling to use the new `showAsTodayAppointment` variable instead of `isToday`

3. Enhanced the "Today" badge to show "Urgent!" for yesterday's late appointments:
   ```typescript
   {showAsTodayAppointment && (
       <Badge className="text-xs px-2 py-0.5 bg-red-500 text-white animate-pulse">
           {isYesterdayLate ? 'Urgent!' : 'Today!'}
       </Badge>
   )}
   ```

## Testing and Verification
The solution was verified using a debug script that confirmed:

1. The server correctly identifies today as August 11, 2025
2. Yesterday's appointments after 18:00 (including the 23:59 appointment) are correctly included in the results
3. The modified query correctly returns both today's appointments and yesterday evening's appointments

## Conclusion
This fix ensures that late night appointments (after 6 PM) from the previous day will appear in the dashboard along with today's appointments, making sure important appointments aren't missed when they occur around midnight.
